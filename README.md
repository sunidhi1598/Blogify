📝 Blogify – Simple Full Stack Blog App
📖 Overview

Blogify is a lightweight blogging web application built to showcase full-stack development using the MERN ecosystem (without React for simplicity).
It focuses on implementing CRUD functionality — Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts — through REST APIs connected to MongoDB Atlas.

💡 Why I Built It

I built Blogify to strengthen my backend fundamentals and demonstrate the ability to develop a complete Node.js application that interacts with a database and renders a dynamic frontend.
This project helped me practice Express routing, REST APIs, EJS templating, MongoDB integration, and cloud deployment — all essential skills for backend and full-stack roles.

⚙️ How It Works

Backend built with Node.js + Express.js for handling routes and API logic

Data stored in MongoDB Atlas, managed via Mongoose ORM

EJS templates render blog posts dynamically on the frontend

Bootstrap 5 used for clean, responsive UI design

Fully tested CRUD routes: create, view, read (“Read More”), edit, and delete posts

Deployed live using Render (backend) with code hosted on GitHub

🚀 Key Features

✅ RESTful API endpoints
✅ Server-side rendering with EJS
✅ MongoDB Atlas integration
✅ Fully deployed and accessible online
✅ Responsive Bootstrap 5 design
