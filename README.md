📝 Blogify – Simple Full Stack Blog App

Overview:
Blogify is a lightweight blogging web application designed to showcase full-stack development using the MERN ecosystem (without React for simplicity). It focuses on implementing CRUD functionality — Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts — through REST APIs connected to MongoDB.

💡 Why I Built It:
I wanted to strengthen my backend fundamentals and demonstrate the ability to build a complete Node.js application that interacts with a database and serves a dynamic frontend. Blogify allowed me to practice routing, REST APIs, templating (EJS), and deployment on Render — all core skills required for backend and full-stack roles.

⚙️ How It Works:

Backend built with Node.js & Express.js for handling routes and API logic

Data stored in MongoDB Atlas, managed via Mongoose ORM

EJS templates render blog posts dynamically

Bootstrap 5 provides a responsive UI with a clean, modern layout

Fully tested CRUD routes: Create new post, view all posts, read full post (“Read More”), edit and delete existing posts

Deployed live using Render (backend) and GitHub for version control

🚀 Key Features:

RESTful API endpoints

Server-side rendering with EJS

MongoDB Atlas integration

Deployed and accessible online

Responsive design with Bootstrap

🔧 Tech Stack:

Frontend: EJS, Bootstrap 5

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Deployment: Render (Backend), GitHub (Code Repository)
